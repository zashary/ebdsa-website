# East Bay DSA website

This project aims to replace the existing NationBuilder-backed site with a
new website built in Rails, that gives us an easy platform for technical
volunteers to join, and a solid foundation for building advanced features
going forward.

## Getting Started

### Quick start for OSX

```sh
# Clone the repository source to local machine:
git clone git@github.com:eastbaydsa/website.git ebdsa-website
cd ebdsa-website

# Get credentials from someone and add them to .env
# Get datadump file and put in tmp/ directory

# In the cloned directory, run bootstrap script to setup up dependencies:
script/bootstrap

# Run script to setup the database:
script/setup

# Start local server
script/server

# Your site will be available at http://localhost:5000
open http://localhost:5000
```

Dependencies:

- Ruby >= 2.4.0
- Postgres
  - [postgresapp.com](https://postgresapp.com) is a great option here
  - Alternatively, you can install with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- bundler (gem install bundler)
- foreman (gem install foreman)

### First time setup

Clone the repository source to local machine:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:eastbaydsa/website.git ebdsa-website
cd ebdsa-website
```

In the cloned directory, install your gem dependencies with `bundler`:

```sh
bundle install
```

Create your database and run migrations:

```sh
bin/rake db:setup
bin/rake db:seed
```

And start your local server with `foreman`:

```sh
foreman start
```

Your site will be available at http://localhost:5000

### NationBuilder Data

Events are loaded from NationBuilder via its API. To connect to the API,
you must supply the following three environment variables:

```
NATION_NAME=xxx
NATION_API_TOKEN=xxx
NATION_SITE_SLUG=xxx
```

In development, you can set these in a `.env` file at your application root.

### S3 Upload

We preconfigure some fields to upload file attachments to
[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). For this to work you must supply the
following environment variables:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=xxx
```

In development, you can set these in a `.env` file at your application root.

The AWS key/secret you use must belong to a user with permission to create S3
objects.

The S3 bucket you use should have the following configuration. First, a bucket
policy that allows objects to be publicly readable.

```
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$AWS_BUCKET_NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Substitute `$AWS_BUCKET_NAME` for your actual bucket name.

Uploads are done using
[pre-signed URLs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html)
so no general write permissions should be required.

Next, set a bucket CORS policy that will allow requests coming from the site:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>$SITE_FQDN</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

Substitute `$SITE_FQDN` with your actual site FQDN, including protocol
(`http://`, `https://`) and port number, if one is used.

In development you will probably want to use `http://localhost:5000` to allow
requests from your local dev server.

You can add additional `<AllowedOrigin>` lines if needed.

## Deployment

### Setup

Some helpful info can be found
[here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5).

You'll need to be added as a collaborator on any Heroku apps you want to
deploy to.

Install [the Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
You can use Homebrew to do this:

```sh
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
```

Hook your local repo up to the Heroku app by adding a Git remote:

```sh
heroku git:remote -a eastbaydsa-staging
```

### Running Tests

Set up the test database (only once)

```sh
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create
```

Run the tests

```sh
bundle exec rake
```

### Staging Environment

Visit the stage build at http://eastbaydsa-staging.herokuapp.com to test your changes.

### Deploy

Use Git to push the code to Heroku:

```sh
git push heroku main:master
```

You can name any local branch you want, but if should be pushed to the `master`
branch on Heroku.

TODO(bcipriano) This is fine for the staging app, but once a prod app is
running we should ensure only `main` can be pushed there.

Next, run db migrations:

```sh
heroku run rake db:migrate
```

You can use the Heroku CLI to open the app in your browser:

```sh
heroku open
```

## Suggested Testing Steps

Suggested testing steps for major version updates. These don't need to be run on every update but are good to run if you're worried about possible breaking changes.

It's best to test these in [staging](https://eastbaydsa-staging.herokuapp.com/).

- Go through a couple of pages and make everything looks similar to production. Such as [committees](https://eastbaydsa-staging.herokuapp.com/committees/), and [donate](https://eastbaydsa-staging.herokuapp.com/donate/).
- Make sure the [calendar page](https://eastbaydsa-staging.herokuapp.com/events/) loads
- Log into the [admin page](https://eastbaydsa-staging.herokuapp.com/admin/)
-- Create a new content page, with an uploaded file [here](https://eastbaydsa-staging.herokuapp.com/admin/pages/new/)


## Troubleshooting

### Updating your DB

After pulling main, if you notice changes to `db/schema.rb`, run

```bash
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

If this command fails, try running `bundle`, and then retry the above command.

### Postgres issues

If you encounter this error while working with the database:

```
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
    Is the server running locally and accepting
    connections on Unix domain socket "/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```

This can be fixed by adding the following environment variable to your shell
profile (`~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PGHOST=localhost
```

This works because if `PGHOST` is not defined, Postgres will attempt to connect
to a Unix domain socket instead.
