    <p>Support the socialist movement by contributing monthly dues to East Bay DSA!</p>

    <p>We're a democratic organization run and funded by our members. Whether it's strike support, canvassing, membership meetings, or educational events, your support makes our organizing possible.</p>

    <p><b>East Bay DSA is campaigning with Oakland School Board candidate Sasha Ritzie-Hernandez to take power back from the billionaire-backed charter schools.</b> When you sign up to be a local dues paying member, we can organize and win more class-struggle elections.</p>

    <p>If you would like to change the amount you currently send to DSA, please visit the donorbox portal <a href="https://donorbox.org/user_session/new">here</a>.</p>

    <p><em>We are a 501(c)(4) organization so your donation is not tax-deductible.</em></p>
